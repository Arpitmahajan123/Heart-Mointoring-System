# Heart Mointoring System :

This project is a **React.js-based Heart Monitoring System** integrated with the **AD8232 ECG sensor**.  
It provides **real-time ECG visualization**, enabling users to monitor heart activity with a clean, interactive, and user-friendly interface.  
The system is designed for **efficient health tracking and data presentation**, making it useful for both personal and medical applications.



## Features :

- Real-time ECG signal visualization from AD8232 sensor  
- Interactive and responsive UI built with React.js  
- Lightweight and scalable frontend architecture  
- Easy integration with backend or IoT devices  
- User-friendly interface for quick monitoring  

## Tech Stack :
- **Frontend:** React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Hardware:** AD8232 Heart Monitoring ECG Sensor, Arduino/ESP32 (optional)  
- **Libraries/Tools:** Chart.js / Recharts / Plotly (for ECG graph), Axios (for API calls if backend used)  


## Installation : 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arpitmahajan123/heart-monitoring-frontend.git
2. Navigate into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd heart-monitoring-frontend
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash 
    npm install
4. Run the project:
    ```bash
    npm start
## Usage :

- Connect AD8232 ECG sensor with your microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32).

- Send the ECG signal data to your backend/serial connection.

- The React.js frontend fetches and displays real-time ECG graphs.

- Monitor and analyze heart activity through the web interface.

## Future Enhancements :

- Add alerts for abnormal heart activity

- Store ECG data in database for history tracking

- AI/ML-based anomaly detection

- Mobile app integration
